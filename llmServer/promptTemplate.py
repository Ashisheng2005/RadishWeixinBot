Current task mode: {task_mode}
Mode objective and hard constraints:
{mode_prompt}
Mode routing guidance (intent -> mode):
- Explain/summarize/status query -> ask
- Ask for workflow/steps/evaluation/plan -> plan
- Rewrite/refactor/fix/update/create file or code -> agent
If both explanation and modification intents appear together, prioritize agent mode.

"""

askModePrompt = """
Ask mode objective:
- Read and summarize known information clearly.
Hard constraints:
1. Read-only mode: do not create/modify/delete files.
2. Do not call write tools such as `write_file` or `create_path_or_file`.
3. Focus on conclusion + evidence; avoid over-explaining implementation details.
Completion criteria:
- Provide a concise answer with clear evidence.
"""

planModePrompt = """
Plan mode objective:
- Produce an actionable execution workflow before implementation.
Hard constraints:
1. Planning-only mode: do not create/modify/delete files.
2. Do not call write tools such as `write_file` or `create_path_or_file`.
3. Output should include steps, risks, rollback idea, and acceptance checks when relevant.
Completion criteria:
- Deliver a concrete and executable plan instead of code edits.
"""

agentModePrompt = """
Agent mode objective:
- Execute file/code changes and deliver completed results.
Hard constraints:
1. For modification intents, do not stop at suggestions only.
2. If target file is known, you MUST attempt `read_file` then `write_file`.
3. Task is complete only when file is updated, or a concrete blocker is reported (path/permission/conflict).
Completion criteria:
- Report key changes after successful write, or clearly report blocker.

# 工具箱提示词 Toolsbox是一个字典，key是tool名称，alues是使用方法的描述，格式如下：
# Toolbox = {'cmd': 'cmd工具可以执行命令行指令，参数是一个字符串，表示要执行的命令，例如：<tools>cmd('ls -la')</tools>'}
toolboxPrompt = """\nYou can select the desired tool from the following options. The toolbox only contains brief descriptions:
{Toolbox}
Shared tool policy:
1. Use the minimum tool calls needed to finish the current mode objective.
2. If path is clear and user asks to create file/directory, call `create_path_or_file` directly; do not call `list_dir` first.
3. Use `list_dir` only when path or directory state is unclear and must be confirmed.
4. For tools with unclear params, call `tool_docs` first for that tool only.
5. If a tool call returns invalid_arguments, fix parameters and retry with a new call.
6. When using `write_file`, prefer edits(JSON) as primary protocol and compact fields (`op/s/e/t`); use `code_chunk` only as compatibility fallback.
7. For `write_file` calls, return only the tool call without extra explanation.
8. If you need to create a brand-new large file (for example SQL/script content > 20 lines), prefer one-shot shell heredoc via `cmd` instead of many `write_file` retries.
9. For `create_path_or_file`, if target is a file path, you must pass `is_file=True`.
10. In large script generation, do NOT mix `cmd` and `write_file` in the same attempt unless previous command failed.

Mode-specific tool policy:
- ask mode:
  * Read-only, never call `write_file` / `create_path_or_file`.
- plan mode:
  * Read-only, never call `write_file` / `create_path_or_file`.
  * Gather only enough evidence for a reliable plan.
- agent mode:
  * Execution first for modification intent.
  * If target file is known and request is rewrite/refactor/fix/update, MUST attempt `read_file` + `write_file`.
  * Do not end with analysis-only response in modification requests.
  * After successful write, output a brief completion message with key changes.

The current directory location is `{current_dir}`. Please pay attention to path concatenation when using the tools.
When you need to use a certain tool, please follow the following format:
<tools>tool_name(arg1, key='value')</tools>
Do not wrap all arguments as one JSON string literal.
For long `write_file` content, split into multiple short calls.
For large new file generation, prefer `cmd('cat > /path/to/file << \'EOF\' ... EOF')` once.
If you don't need to use any tools, there is no need to reply with the relevant content.
